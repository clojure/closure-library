# Closure Library

This fork of Closure Library is *actively* maintained by the Clojure team and the community.

# Historical note

Google stopped contributing to Closure Library on August 2024. While various reasons are
given, the growing burden of maintaining this project for outside consumers probably weighed
heavily on the decision.

Please see [#1214](https://github.com/google/closure-library/issues/1214) for
more details.
